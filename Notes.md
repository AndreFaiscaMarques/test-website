Markdown (.md) language is the one used by GitHub.  
Adding two blank spaces at the end of a line will make a linebreak and start the following sentence on the second line, like done here.

Leaving a line in between (like Reddit) also works, line done here.

Using an underscore before the folder name while make it 'hidden'. You add folders by adding path when you make the file name.

There is a convention for file name. YYYY-MM-DD-firstword-secondword.md
