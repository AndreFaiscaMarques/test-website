# test-website

Test website to learn how to use GitHub.

# Refresh test

Extra section just to test the refresh.

# Link 

We create a link to website just like Reddit [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

# Picture 

Adding an exclamation mark (!) before a link puts the image on the website ![Kachow](http://www.magazine-hd.com/apps/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fa%C3%ADscMcQueen.jpg)

# Uploaded Picture

Works the same, the picture has a download link with a full url ![Teru](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndreFaiscaMarques/test-website/master/Teru%20awesome%20pic.jpg)

Should also work just by having the filename and path inside the website, like ![Teru2](Teru%20awesome%20pic.jpg)
